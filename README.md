- 👋 Hi, I’m @EmilieVS.
- 👀 I’m interested in web and mobile development. I would love to do gaming too at some point but for now I want to focus on web and mobile.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting project that fit with my learning goal. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning so many things ! I know Javascript, Python and I just started Java and React (on my own). I also know a bit of ThreeJS and Globe JS.
- 📫 How to reach me ? Mainly on : https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilie-vincent-sully/ 
- ⚡ Fun fact : this is actuallly my second (career) life ! A few months ago, I was doing something completely different for a living.
