- 👋 Hello, my name is Emilie.
  
- 👩‍💻 I'm a junior fullstack developper (mainly interested in backend to be honest) but I can handle the front just fine. I'm currently on training at Ada Tech School.
- 👀 I’m interested in working in web or mobile development. I would love to do gaming too at some point but I don't think of it for now.
- 💞️ My main backend languages are Php and Java. I've done a bit of python too.
I started programming in Python on my own about a year ago(on Udemy) but since, I had the opportunity to try Php and Java recently and I loved it ! 
- 🌱 Now I can handle framework such as Spring Boot and Laravel !
- As for frontend frameworks : my main is Vue.js but I will go further on React as soon as I can. 
I've also used librairies like ThreeJS and Globe JS.
