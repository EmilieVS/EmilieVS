- 👋 Hello, my name is Emilie.
  
- 👩‍💻 I'm a junior fullstack developper (mainly interested in backend to be honest) but I can handle the front just fine. I'm currently on training at Ada Tech School.
- 👀 I’m interested in working in web or mobile development. I would love to do gaming too at some point but I don't think of it for now.
- 💞️ My backend languages are Python and Java.
I started programming in Python on my own about a year ago(on Udemy) but I had the opportunity to learn Java recently and I loved it ! 
- 🌱 I will soon learn some frameworks. I'm mainly interested in React.
I've already used SpringBoot, I also know a bit of ThreeJS and Globe JS.
